**Breast Cancer Predictor App**

This web application is built to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer using machine learning. It leverages a logistic regression model to predict whether a breast tissue sample is benign or malignant based on various cell nucleus measurements. The app accepts input via sliders for several key features, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, and concavity, and provides real-time predictions.

The app uses Streamlit for the interactive user interface, making it easy to input data and visualize the results. A radar chart displays the input data, showcasing the mean value, standard error, and worst value for each measurement.

Features:
Real-time predictions of whether the cell cluster is benign or malignant.
Visual representation of input data using a radar chart.
Probability scores for benign and malignant predictions.
User-friendly interface for medical professionals to input data and get predictions.

This app is designed to assist healthcare professionals in making a diagnosis. It should not be used as a substitute for a professional diagnosis.
